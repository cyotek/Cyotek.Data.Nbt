### Cyotek.Data.Nbt

This is a library for reading and writing NBT format files used by Minecraft. However, the format is versatile enough to use for many other applications.

It was originally based on [LibNBT](http://libnbt.codeplex.com/) found on CodePlex, but I've made a lot of changes to it to make it easier to use in real world applications. Or at least easier for me in mine!

> Note: I haven't fully tested this. It works so far from what I'm using it for, but no doubt bugs exist. I need to adapt (and expand) the original tests that were written for the library to ensure I haven't broken anything.
